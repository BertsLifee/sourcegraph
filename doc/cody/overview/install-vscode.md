    </a>
  </li>
</ul>

## Prerequisites

- To use Cody in VS Code, make sure you have it installed. Read more information [here â†’](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
- A Sourcegraph instance with Cody enabled on it or a Sourcegraph.com account.

Learn more with the following resources:
If you haven't yet done this, read the following resources:

- [Enabling Cody for Sourcegraph Enterprise][enable-cody-enterprise]
- [Enabling Cody for Sourcegraph.com][cody-with-sourcegraph]

## Install the VS Code extension

You can install Cody in VS Code in 2 ways:

- Click the Extensions icon on the VS Code activity bar
- Search for "Cody AI"
- Install the extension directly to VS Code

Or:

- [Download and install the extension from the VS Code marketplace][cody-vscode-marketplace]

## Connect the extension to Sourcegraph

Next, you'll open the VS Code extension and configure it to connect to a Sourcegraph instance (either an enterprise instance or Sourcegraph.com).

**For Sourcegraph Enterprise users:**

Log in to your Sourcegraph instance and go to `settings` / `access token` (`https://<your-instance>.sourcegraph.com/users/<your-instance>/settings/tokens`). From here, generate a new access token.

Then, you will paste your access token and instance address in to the Cody extension.

**For Sourcegraph.com users:**

Click `Continue with Sourcegraph.com` in the Cody extension. From there, you'll be taken to Sourcegraph.com, which will authenticate your extension.

## (Optional) Enable code graph context for context-aware answers

You can optional configure code graph content, which gives Cody the ability to provide context-aware answers. For example, Cody can write example API calls if has context of a codebase's API schema.
